# README

This folder contains the notebook for performing inference using YOLOv8 and Slicing Aided Hyper Inference for Small Object Detection.

There is one notebook in this folder:

* `sahi_yolov8_inference.ipynb`: Uses YOLOv8-S and SAHI for small object detection inference.

Addionally, there is a folder called `test_images`. It contains few example input images that have been used for experimentation.
