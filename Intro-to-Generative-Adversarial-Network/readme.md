## Package Dependencies

The repository trains the Generative Adversarial Network in both Pytorch and Tensorflow on Fashion-MNIST dataset. It is tested with:

- `Cuda-11.1`
- `Cudnn-8.0`

The Pytorch and Tensorflow scripts require [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install), [torch](https://pypi.org/project/torch/). 
To get the versions of these packages you need for the program, use pip: (Make sure pip is upgraded: ` python3 -m pip install -U pip`)
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
```

## Instructions

### PyTorch

To train the Generative Adversarial Network with Pytorch, please go into the `Pytorch` folder and execute either the Python script or the Jupyter Notebook.

### TensorFlow

To train the Generative Adversarial Network with TensorFlow, please go into the `Tensorflow` folder and execute either the Python script or the Jupyter Notebook.
