# README

This folder contains the source code and pre-trained models required for real-time facial emotion recognition.

Let's look into the contents:

* There is a folder called `RFB-320` that has the face detection model pre-trained on `FER+` dataset.

* `emotion-ferplus-8.onnx` is the custom VGG13 classification model used for emotion classification.
* `expression-ssd-detection.py` is the main script that allows this system to function.
