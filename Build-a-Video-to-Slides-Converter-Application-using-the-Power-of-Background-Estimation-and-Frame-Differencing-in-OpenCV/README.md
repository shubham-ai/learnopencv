### Install required packages

After unzipping the file `Build-a-Video-to-Slides-Converter-Application-using-the-Power-of-Background-Estimation-and-Frame-Differencing-in-OpenCV`, run the following command in your virtual environment:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Execution

The command line flags are as follows:

* `video_file_path`: The path to the input video file.
* `out_dir`: The path to the output directory where the results would be stored.
* `type`: The type of background subtraction method to be applied. It can be one of: Frame_Diff, GMG (default), or KNN.
* `no_post_process`: flag to specify whether to apply the post-processing step. If not specified, the post-processing step is always applied as default.
* `convert_to_pdf`: flag to specify whether to convert the image set into a single PDF file.


An example usage can be:

```
python video_2_slides.py -v ./sample_vids/Neural_Networks_Overview.mp4 -o output_results --type GMG --convert_to_pdf
```
