# FCOS- Anchor Free Object Detection Explained with Code

**FCOS:** Fully Convolutional One-stage Object Detection is an anchor-free (anchorless) object detector. It solves object detection problems in a per-pixel prediction fashion, similar to segmentation. Most of the recent anchor-free or anchorless deep learning-based object detectors use FCOS as a basis. This repository contains code for the blog post [FCOS- Anchor Free Object Detection Explained with Code](learnopencv.com/fcos-anchor-free-object-detection-explained/).
